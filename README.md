# Book Listing

## Description

This project displays books from a JSON file. It contains code provided by the Full Stack Development with MERN course, with edits by me.

## How to Run

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Download all files.
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
3. Open PowerShell or a terminal window.
4. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the files.
5. Start a server in that folder. You can use Python's built-in HTTP server by running the command:
python -m http.server


For Python 2.x, use:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Or, if you have Node.js installed, you can use the `http-server` package by running:
npx http-server


6. Once the server is running, open your web browser and enter the address of the server.
7. You should now be able to view the project.

## Future Improvements

In future versions, I plan to make the subtitle at the top smaller and italicized.
